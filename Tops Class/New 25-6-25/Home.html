            Indian companies are primarily governed by the Companies Act, 2013, which regulates their formation, management, and dissolution. The Act provides for various types of companies, including private, public, one-person, and Section 8 (non-profit) companies. A key feature of the Act is the mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending for certain companies, making India the first country to introduce such a law.
